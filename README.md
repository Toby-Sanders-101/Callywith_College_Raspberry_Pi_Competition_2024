# Raspberry Pi Competition - PA Consulting
## Introduction
This app was developed by the team at Callywith College for the PA Raspberry Pi Competition 2024, where the objective was to create software (predominantly using a raspberry pi) that can help someone's health. It is designed to analyse the health of the user using a series of questions, sensors and calculations. The target audience is gamer's as they are a notoriously unhealthy subpopulation.
